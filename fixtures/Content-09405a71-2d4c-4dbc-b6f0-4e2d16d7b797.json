    "body": "<body><p>My precious (part 2).</p>\n<p>Gold is still drawing in new fans, as prices hit a new <a href=\"http://on.ft.com/1VUSVfu\">13-month high</a> in early trading today, entering bull market territory after a 21.8 per cent from the recent low in December. The latest weekly flow data crunched by Bank of America Merrill Lynch show investors flooded $7.9bn in four weeks into gold funds, the largest inflows in seven years.</p>\n<p>The allure of the shiny stuff can be pinned on apparently conflicting factors. On the one hand, the possibility of ever-sinking benchmark deposit rates may be pushing some investors into the market, as UBS argues. (See <a href=\"http://on.ft.com/1VUSVfu\">more on that here</a>.)</p>\n<p>On the other, it could be down to a resurgence in inflation expectations, as this chart from Capital Economics illustrates rather nicely.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.ft.com/fastft/files/2016/03/march-4-gold.png\"><img alt=\"\" height=\"438\" src=\"http://www.ft.com/fastft/files/2016/03/march-4-gold.png\" width=\"641\"/></a></p>\n<p>Says Julian Jessop at Capital Economics:</p>\n<blockquote><p>You can’t say it’s safe haven demand. Equity markets are higher, for example. But inflation expectations are returning. Gold is always driven by different factors at different times. One view is that gold will inevitably fall because of the Fed tightening, but my point is that the drivers change, and we’re seeing a paradigm shift.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Either way, happy days for gold bugs.</p>\n</body>"
